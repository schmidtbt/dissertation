        Calculate for each vertex, the number of non-zero connections
        coming into that vertex. Additionally calculate the number of
        non-zero connections going out of this node
        
        Inflow is number causing that vertex
        Outflow is number that this vertex causes
        
        Columns cause rows
        
        Use thresholding on input to restrict gc values to those of
        interested (eg significant only according to prb)
